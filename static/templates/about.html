        <div class="clubhub-biglabel"> About ClubHub</div>
        ClubHub is a platform to streamline communication between Princeton clubs and interested students.
        You can search for clubs by keywords (such as consulting, chess, math, etc) and by tags (such as A Cappella, Sports/Recreation, Political, etc).
        If you're interested in a club, you can subscribe to receive email notifications from the club's officers. You can also subscribe to
        entire tags of clubs to receive email notifications from all of the clubs under that tag. <br><br>

        To manage your subscriptions, visit your profile page. If you're an officer of a club, you can also edit your club's information, add new officers, and send announcements via your profile page. <br><br>

        If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to <a href="mailto:clubhub-admin@princeton.edu">clubhub-admin@princeton.edu</a>!
